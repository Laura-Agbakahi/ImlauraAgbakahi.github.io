            <p>Life is a wild adventure, and sometimes it feels like we're strapped into the front seat of a rollercoaster.</p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/image_1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>Well, folks, it looks like I've finally stumbled upon my calling after dabbling in just about everything under the sun. And believe me, I've tried a lot of things! My buddy Ntutu always used to tell me, "Laura, one step at a time."

              I first dipped my toes into the world of drawing when I was just a wee one. I vividly remember my very first attempt during my Junior WAEC, we were tasked with drawing our hand holding something visible. I chose to draw my hand holding a leaf. I'll never forget it because my teachers were blown away. My fine art teacher even reached out to congratulate me and urged me to follow this artistic path. I was absolutely over the moon and couldn't wait to dive in.
              
              But, alas, my dad had grander plans in mind. He envisioned me as a doctor, nurse, or something along those lines, definitely not as an art student. According to him, "How much can you make drawing for people?" Naive as I was, I bought into the idea without fully grasping the essence of art as life itself.
              
              <p>After graduating as an administrator, real-world experience exposed me to a whole new level of practicality that went beyond what I had learned in school. I ventured into the realm of technology, setting up customized emails, collaborating with designers on magazine projects, organizing the Miss Nigeria beauty pageant, and using accounting software, among other things. It was here that I realized the immense importance of technology. Having a purpose fueled my curiosity to rediscover my passion. I grappled with finding the balance between my formal education, my experiences, and my true passion, fully aware that what mattered most was how I could apply my skills to provide solutions.
              
              I'll take you on a rollercoaster ride through my journey what I did, the plans I made, and the challenges I faced. 
              
              <p>Eventually, I figured it out. My first step as a content creator was to design my own unique and captivating material. Creating content was the name of the game</p>.
              
              <p>In this wild ride, I tried my hand at web design, yep, the whole coding shebang. I excelled at it and even won an award as the best graduating Microsoft NWT student. I began my software engineering lessons with ALX (still a work in progress), but then a pesky thought about getting too old for this game since I started a bit later than others crept in. I temporarily abandoned that journey and pivoted to UI/UX design, only to leave it for the world of business analysis. All the while, I continued drawing and crafting incredible video ads for people ‚Äì something I learned with just a N1000 course fee and grew to love. It was during this creative journey that I realized I needed to expand my skill set in this niche ‚Äì things like copywriting, animation, and digital marketing.
              
              Boom! I started taking baby steps, dedicating time and brainstorming, one thing at a time. And here you are, reading this post.</p>
              
              <p>Ta-da! I'm thrilled to announce that I'm now a certified digital marketer and web designer. My goal is to build a career in business analysis where I can leverage my tools and experiences, both professionally and for my personal projects.</p> <p> I've handled various tasks as showcased in the portfolio, and I'm excited to educate those looking to switch or transition into the world of tech and non-coding tech pathways.
              
              So, there you have it, my journey from drawing leaves to becoming a certified digital dynamo. Stay tuned for more exciting updates and adventures in the tech universe!
              
              Cheers,
              Laura Agbakahi

            <p>Took me hours to write this thoughüòÅ.  This post is only for those who want to make a change in their lives  . 

              There are prospective students or even students who just want to go through school because others did it, they have no purpose, no drive, most are studying what they hate. There are some who have graduated and within the ages of 30 to 45 with an 8 to 5 job, with no clear vision on how to create solutions to global issues. Hey i am not here to judge but to rejuggle the inactivity and take you closer to what you are missing out.
              
              We all have had dreams of becoming professionals in a given field and then probably when we graduate, we get a job with a multinational firm where we work 8am to 5pm. Now here is the trick, Tick Tok Tick Tok Tick Tok, and the years roll by. Guess what, that dream you‚Äôve always had is extinct, with global changes, sequences and processes ever changing as well. If you haven't heard about robots becoming helpers at home or assistants at the office, then you need to watch this.   Now one thing you should know is, robots are man made. In truth someone is solving a solution. That leaves you to think, what can I do?  Currently,  No one is talking about sitting at the office from 8 to 5 or hoping to get sustainability from it</p>.  
              
              Side gigs, hustle, business, as it‚Äôs called, can gravitate you to greater  heights of wealth.  
<br><br>
              So how do you find it to get scored?
              Finding the ‚Äúit‚Äù can be dicey and most times hopes are misplaced or either lost. 
              I can recount how many billionaires I have conversed with or let's just say with those who successfully  paved their way in life, many of them try out different versions of startups and consistently follow through, losing and learning while they grow stronger and stronger. Overall, they love what they do. 
              
              So if  you must know, I just discovered my wax after years of trying out different things. Prior to now, I have invested time upskilling, doing stuff and discovering what works and what doesn‚Äôt. If you check my portfolio, I graduated as an administrator but now I position startups or existing businesses in the online business world using tech tools. In truth, no robot can do this, I dare developers. I love what I do and I will keep doing it while educating people in need to discover their path, on ways to go about it. 
              <ul>
              <li>Do what you love and also you can earn.</li> 
<li>Reexamine yourself on where your strength is at max .</li> 
<li>Ask how you can upskill </li>
<li>Learn from the best and get secrets to every business</li>
<li>Evaluate your environment / target audience</li>
<li>Plan</li> 
<li>Implement </li>
<li>Fail </li>
<li>Regain and reexamine again.</li> 

All the best
